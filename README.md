A Strategy Game by two players. Its UI is command window.


This is a Strategy Game by two players. Each player makes one move simultaneously in every round.

There are four kinds of moves: ABSORB, ATTACK, DEFEND and REFLECT.
ABSORB: Gain one unit of Chi.
ATTACK: Consume Chi to attack. Level N attack consumes N unit(s) of Chi, where N is an integer determined by you. N must be between 1 and the unit(s) of Chi you have.
DEFEND: Defuse level 1 and level 2 attack. Level 3 or above attack can overrun it!
REFLECT: Reflect opponent's attack to himself and defeat him! Except that level 5 or above attack can overrun it. Also, one can reflect only once in a game.

If you attack and your opponent absorbs, you win. Vice versa.
If your level of ATTACK is greater than that of your opponent, or you overrun his defense or reflection, you win. Vice versa.
If your level of ATTACK is the same as that of your opponent, you both will be fine.
